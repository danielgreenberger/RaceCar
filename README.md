# RaceCar




## Introduction

RaceCar is a robust robotic car platform which can be used for a wide variety of applications. 

TODO add explanation about ROS. 


This document descripbes the integration of the RaceCar platform with with ROS.  


## Motivation

The integration with ROS has a few great advantages:
1. modularity - ROS comes with many built-in and other usefull tools which can be used on the platform
2. infrastructure - ROS provides communication between nodes
3. Third party support - For example RealSense has a ROS driver (better than re-implementing)
